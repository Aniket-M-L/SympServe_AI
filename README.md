# SympServe_AI
SympServe_AI is a health-focused AI agent built to provide answers on symptoms, wellness, and general medical guidance. It responds only to health-related queries and avoids non-medical topics. Ideal for virtual health assistants, chatbots, or wellness platforms. 


🧠 SympServe.AI
An AI-powered health advisor built with IBM Watsonx.ai and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), SympServe.AI assists users in identifying symptoms, understanding potential health conditions, and offering trustworthy preventive healthcare advice. The agent supports multilingual queries and ensures grounded responses by retrieving data from trusted medical documents.


🧩 Problem Statement
Access to reliable and personalized health information remains a challenge—especially in rural or underserved areas. Many people misinterpret symptoms or rely on unverified online sources, leading to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, or unnecessary panic.


💡 Proposed Solution
SympServe.AI is an intelligent health assistant powered by IBM Watsonx.ai that helps users understand their symptoms and receive guidance based on reliable medical documents. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a multilingual interface, the agent provides safe, accessible, and context-aware responses grounded in real health data.
